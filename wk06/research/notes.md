# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: 2025-11-06  
**Context**: Undergraduate student at Leeds, often juggles coursework and daily life tasks. Sometimes worries about forgetting deadlines or small errands.  
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally  
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

### Q1: Last time using a task manager / to-do tool
**Question:** “Tell me about the last time you used a to-do list or task manager. What were you trying to do?”

**Response (summary):**  
About ten minutes ago, while working on a document, they suddenly remembered that the tomato ketchup at home was almost finished and today was Thursday. They didn’t want to break their flow of studying, so they quickly opened the task app on their laptop (e.g. Todoist or Mac Reminders), typed something like “Go downstairs to buy ketchup from the supermarket”, and set a reminder for 7pm. The whole process took only a few seconds. The main purpose was to “offload” the task from their brain so they wouldn’t keep thinking about it.

**Observations:**
- Uses task tools to **protect focus** while studying.
- To-do list acts as an **external memory** (“unload from brain”).
- Very quick, low-friction capture is important (a few seconds only).

**Themes:** `external_memory`, `focus_protection`, `quick_capture`

### Q2: Most frustrating part of managing tasks
**Question:** “What frustrates you most about managing tasks? Can you give a specific example?”

**Response (summary):**  
The most frustrating thing is when **“organising the tasks becomes another heavy task”**. They tried using a fancy Notion system: every time they added a task, they had to choose tags, priority, due date, link to a project page, etc. Even a small task like “pick up a parcel” took about a minute to enter. As a result, they became too lazy to record small tasks, and big tasks were entered in a messy way. The list then filled up with overdue tasks in scary red text, which created a strong sense of failure. Eventually they avoided opening the tool and abandoned it.

**Observations:**
- Over-complicated tools create **cognitive load** and friction.
- Too many required fields stops them from recording tasks at all.
- Red overdue indicators create **emotional pressure** and guilt.
- When the UI feels “judgmental”, they tend to abandon the system.

**Themes:** `cognitive_load`, `over_complexity`, `emotional_pressure`, `overdue_stress`

### Q3: Forgetting important tasks / coursework
**Question:** “Have you ever forgotten an important task or assignment? What happened?”

**Response (summary):**  
Yes, one case was very memorable. For a COMP1850 Week 8 portfolio, they completely mixed up the deadline, thinking it was due next Friday when it was actually this Friday. On the night of the real deadline, they were playing games in their room. A roommate casually asked if they had submitted the portfolio. At that moment they felt a “boom” in their head and started sweating. The next hour was a nightmare: they rushed through the work and submitted something they felt was low quality. The teacher still passed it, but they were unhappy with their own attitude. After this event, they forced themselves to start using calendar/reminder tools more seriously.

**Observations:**
- Deadline confusion can lead to **panic** and last-minute, low-quality work.
- Social reminders (roommate question) can accidentally “save” them.
- A strong negative experience can push someone to adopt tools more seriously.
- Needs **clear, reliable deadline visibility**.

**Themes:** `deadline_confusion`, `panic`, `low_quality_work`, `tool_adoption`

### Q4: Using keyboard only (no mouse / trackpad)
**Question:** “When you use only the keyboard (no mouse/trackpad), what kinds of interfaces feel hardest to use?”

**Response (summary):**  
The hardest are interfaces with many pop-ups or messy layers, such as some video sites’ dashboards or old-style academic/teaching systems. When a pop-up appears (e.g. an advert or notification), they try to use Tab to reach the “X” close button, but the focus jumps around the background menus instead, never landing on the close button. In the end they have to grab the mouse. They feel very frustrated and “out of control” when they cannot control focus.  
They also mentioned that on very “white” pages it is easy to lose the mouse cursor visually and not know where it is.

**Observations:**
- Poor focus management makes pop-ups almost impossible to dismiss with keyboard.
- This breaks the feeling of control and excludes keyboard-only users.
- Visual design with lots of white space makes the cursor hard to find.

**Themes:** `keyboard_navigation`, `focus_management`, `popup_overlays`, `cursor_visibility`

### Q5: Strong light / tired eyes when using devices
**Question:** “In strong light or when your eyes are very tired, what difficulties do you face using computer/phone?”

**Response (summary):**  
In strong sunlight (outdoors), they struggle with “minimalist” apps that use light grey text on white backgrounds. Even with screen brightness at maximum, the text is almost unreadable; they have to use their hand to block the light.  
When their eyes are very tired (e.g. after staying up late), pure black background with pure white text is also uncomfortable. The white text produces a “halo” effect and feels very harsh, causing eye strain. In that state they would prefer a softer dark grey background and not such extreme contrast.

**Observations:**
- Low contrast in bright light creates **situational vision problems**.
- Over-high contrast (pure black/white) can also be uncomfortable when tired.
- Needs flexible themes: not just “light” vs “dark”, but **comfortable contrast**.

**Themes:** `contrast`, `situational_disability`, `theme_comfort`, `eye_strain`

---

### Q6: Feature that would reduce anxiety about tasks
**Question:** “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”

**Response (summary):**  
They would like an **“intelligent forgiveness” or “automatic de-stress”** feature. At the moment, tools feel cold and strict: once a task is overdue it turns red and shows warnings. Instead, when there are, for example, 10 overdue tasks, the system should behave more like a helpful assistant:  
- Suggest automatically postponing 5 non-urgent tasks to next week,  
- Offer to delete 3 tasks that seem unimportant,  
- Ask the person to focus only on the 1 most important task today.  

In other words, the tool should help them **do less and focus**, instead of just shouting about everything being overdue. They also mentioned that they like to set **different priority levels** for tasks themselves.

**Observations:**
- Wants the system to help with **prioritisation and pruning**, not just add pressure.
- Overdue highlighting alone increases anxiety.
- Intelligent grouping (“these can wait / these can be dropped / this one matters”) would feel supportive.
- Manual priority setting is important, but they want tool support on top.

**Themes:** `anxiety_reduction`, `prioritisation`, `overdue_management`, `supportive_feedback`

## Summary (Participant A)

**Top pain points:**
1. Tools that are too complex or “judgy” (lots of fields, red overdue dates) create stress and cause them to abandon the system.  
2. Deadline confusion can lead to panic and rushed, low-quality submissions; they need clearer, more reliable deadline support.  
3. Keyboard-only navigation is painful when focus skips important controls (like close buttons), and white-heavy designs make the cursor hard to see.  
4. Visual design issues (low contrast in bright light, extreme contrast when tired) make it hard or uncomfortable to read.  
5. Current tools increase pressure by shouting about overdue tasks instead of helping to reduce and re-prioritise them.


## Participant B
**Date**: 2025-11-11  
**Context**: Student who mixes digital and physical tools (sticky notes, apps). Often juggles group work, personal commitments and study.  
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally  
**Duration**: ~10 minutes  

---

### Q1: Last time using a task manager / to-do tool
**Question:** “Tell me about the last time you used a to-do list or task manager. What were you trying to do?”

**Response (summary):**  
This morning before going out for a 9am class. Instead of using a phone app, they stuck a bright yellow sticky note on the door handle with the word “Student ID” written on it. They needed to use the university library printer, and they knew that if they only put a reminder on their phone, they would probably not open the app, or might just swipe the notification away. By putting the sticky note physically in the way, they had to touch it to open the door, which forced them to remember. For them, this is the most reliable form of “task management”.

**Observations:**
- Relies on **physical, interruptive cues** (sticky note blocking the door) rather than purely digital reminders.
- Does not fully trust phone notifications to change behaviour.
- Uses the environment itself as part of the reminder system.

**Themes:** `physical_reminders`, `environmental_cues`, `notification_trust`

### Q2: Most frustrating part of managing tasks
**Question:** “What frustrates you most about managing tasks? Can you give a specific example?”

**Response (summary):**  
The most frustrating part is the **“transfer work”**: taking information from messages and turning it into tasks. In group projects, someone might assign something in a Teams message or @ them in a group chat. To turn that into a task, they have to copy the text, open the to-do app, paste it, set a time, etc. This breaks their flow. Often they think “I’ll write it down later”, and later never comes. By the time they remember, the message has been buried under many new messages and is hard to find again. The worst feeling is that the **“information stream” and “task stream” are disconnected**.

**Observations:**
- Big pain point = friction between **chat tools** and **task tools**.
- “I’ll do it later” leads to tasks being completely forgotten.
- Feels like they are constantly **moving tasks by hand** between systems.

**Themes:** `information_task_gap`, `copy_paste_friction`, `chat_to_task`

---

### Q3: Forgetting important tasks / social commitments
**Question:** “Have you ever forgotten an important task or assignment? What happened?”

**Response (summary):**  
Yes, and it was emotionally painful. They promised a close friend to edit a short blessing video for her wedding. The work itself was not heavy, but they kept thinking “There are still two months before the wedding, no rush”, and never wrote it down anywhere, relying only on memory. Work got busy, and they completely forgot about it. Two days before the wedding, the friend messaged: “Is the video ready? I need to give it to the host.” They felt their hands shaking when they saw the message, full of guilt, as if they had almost ruined something important in their friend’s life. They stayed up two nights to rush the edit and managed to deliver it, but the **fear and guilt** stayed.

**Observations:**
- Forgetting tasks can damage **trust and relationships**, not just grades.
- Shows the risk of relying only on memory for “emotional” tasks (favours, promises).
- Strong emotional impact → potential motivator to use better systems.

**Themes:** `relationship_risk`, `guilt`, `memory_limitations`

---

### Q4: Using keyboard only (no mouse / trackpad)
**Question:** “When you use only the keyboard, what kind of interfaces are hardest to use?”

**Response (summary):**  
Kanban-style boards (like Trello or drag-and-drop project boards) are very hard. When their mouse battery died, they tried to move a card from “In progress” to “Done” using only the keyboard. Arrow keys only moved the cursor within the text, not the card itself. Even if they could focus the card, there was no clear way to “grab” it and move it to the next column with the keyboard. They had to open the card and manually change a status field instead. It felt very frustrating to see the card “right there” but not be able to move it.

**Observations:**
- Drag-and-drop UIs often **do not provide keyboard equivalents**.
- The visual model (cards moving on a board) does not translate to keyboard interaction.
- This creates a feeling of **helplessness** for keyboard-only use.

**Themes:** `drag_and_drop`, `keyboard_inaccessibility`, `kanban_boards`

---

### Q5: Strong light / tired vision
**Question:** “In strong light or when your eyes are tired, what difficulties do you face using computer/phone?”

**Response (summary):**  
When eyes are tired, they especially struggle with **very tight line spacing** in lists. Dense Excel sheets or compact task lists cause lines of text to “merge together”; they lose track of which line they’re on. They sometimes have to use a finger on the screen or the mouse highlight to keep their place, like someone with reading difficulties or presbyopia.

**Observations:**
- Tight line spacing increases **visual and cognitive load**.
- They need some form of **line highlighting or extra spacing** to avoid losing their place.
- Experience feels “like having old-age eyesight”, even though they are young.

**Themes:** `line_spacing`, `readability`, `eye_fatigue`

---

### Q6: Feature that would reduce anxiety about tasks
**Question:** “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”

**Response (summary):**  
They would like a **“geofenced hiding mode”**. When their phone location is at home or when they are clearly relaxing (e.g. gaming), they want all tasks with a “homework/study” tag to be completely hidden — not just greyed out, but invisible, with no red badges or counts. Currently, when they are trying to relax, apps suddenly pop up reminders about meetings or deadlines, and red badges on icons destroy their good mood instantly. They want the tool to understand context: “This is not work time, so don’t show stressful things.” Only then would they feel truly able to rest.

**Observations:**
- Needs **context-aware hiding**, not just constant reminders.
- Red badges and alerts invade leisure time and increase anxiety.
- Wants a clear boundary between **rest time** and **work/academic tasks**.

**Themes:** `context_aware_ui`, `rest_protection`, `notification_anxiety`

---

## Summary (Participant B)

**Main pain points:**
1. Digital reminders are often ignored; **physical, blocking cues** (like sticky notes on the door) work better.  
2. The “transfer” step from chat messages to tasks is high-friction, causing important group-work items to be lost.  
3. Forgetting a promise can seriously damage relationships and creates long-lasting guilt.  
4. Drag-and-drop Kanban boards are almost unusable with keyboard only, making people feel powerless.  
5. Visually dense lists with tight line spacing are hard to read when tired, causing line skipping and confusion.  
6. Current tools invade relaxation time with work/study reminders; they need **location/time-aware hiding** to truly disconnect.


## Participant C
**Date**: 2025-11-13  
**Context**: University student juggling multiple modules, group work and readings. Very sensitive to deadlines after past late-submission penalties.  
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally  
**Duration**: ~10 minutes  

---

### Q1: Last time using a task manager / to-do tool
**Question:** “Tell me about the last time you used a to-do list or task manager. What were you trying to do?”

**Response (summary):**  
About half an hour ago, while queueing for breakfast in the canteen.  
They suddenly had a mini heart attack thinking: “Do we have to submit that group peer review this afternoon?” They quickly pulled out their phone and opened the UniLeeds app to double-check the deadline.  
That intense feeling of “suddenly thinking you’ve missed something while walking around” was very strong. Only after confirming that the deadline was actually midnight did they put the phone away and continue queueing.

**Observations:**
- Classic **“Did I forget something important?” anxiety spike** while on the move.
- The tool is used mainly for **reassurance and checking**, not just recording.
- Task management is tightly linked to emotional state (panic → relief).

**Themes:** `deadline_check`, `anxiety_spike`, `reassurance`

---

### Q2: Most frustrating part of managing tasks
**Question:** “What frustrates you most about managing tasks? Can you give a specific example?”

**Response (summary):**  
The worst thing is **fragmentation of task sources**. Even though the university has a central system, teachers don’t use it consistently:  
- Teacher A posts assignments in the official assignment area,  
- Teacher B only uploads a file in a Minerva announcement,  
- Teacher C just says “hand in the outline next Wednesday” verbally at the end of class with no written record.  

They have to act like a detective, hunting tasks from group chats, emails, announcements and spoken reminders, then manually moving them into their own list.  
If they miss just one spoken instruction, they might lose participation marks. This constant uncertainty is extremely annoying.

**Observations:**
- Assignment information is **highly fragmented** across channels.
- Students are forced to be “manual aggregators” of task information.
- Lack of a reliable, central “single view of all tasks” creates anxiety.

**Themes:** `fragmented_sources`, `manual_aggregation`, `uncertainty`

---

### Q3: Forgetting important tasks / assignments
**Question:** “Have you ever forgotten an important task or assignment? What happened?”

**Response (summary):**  
Yes, a very painful lesson in second year.  
There was a midterm essay. They assumed the deadline was Friday 23:59 (because most courses use that time), so they spent Friday daytime playing games in the dorm, planning to write at night.  
Around 5pm, they went to download some papers and saw a red message: “Deadline: 17:00”. The submission link had turned grey a few minutes earlier.  
They felt completely frozen and sat in shock for about five minutes. They emailed the lecturer to beg for a late submission and were allowed, but with a 30% late penalty. The final grade for that module was awful and dragged down their GPA for postgraduate applications.

**Observations:**
- Dangerous reliance on **default assumptions** about deadlines.
- Not enough salient warning for non-standard deadlines.
- One late assignment can have **long-term impact** on GPA and opportunities.

**Themes:** `wrong_assumption`, `late_penalty`, `long_term_impact`

---

### Q4: Using keyboard only (no mouse / trackpad)
**Question:** “When you use only the keyboard, what kind of interfaces are hardest to use?”

**Response (summary):**  
Reference manager “edit citation” dialogs (e.g. EndNote, Zotero) are particularly hard.  
When writing papers with only the keyboard, trying to change a page number in a small modal window or move the cursor to a specific position in the author field is painful.  
Pressing Tab just cycles through buttons like “OK”, “Cancel”, “More settings” and never seems to land inside the input field they want. In a high-pressure situation (rushing a deadline), this kind of interaction friction makes them want to slam the keyboard.

**Observations:**
- Modal dialogs often have **poor focus order** for keyboard use.
- Hard to control both **cursor position** and **target control** with the keyboard.
- Small interaction problems become much bigger under stress.

**Themes:** `keyboard_focus`, `modal_dialogs`, `stress_amplification`

---

### Q5: Strong light / tired vision
**Question:** “In strong light or when your eyes are tired, what difficulties do you face using computer/phone?”

**Response (summary):**  
Tired eyes usually happen late at night in the dorm when rushing deadlines. Roommates are asleep, only a small desk lamp is on.  
In that situation, **scanned PDF textbooks** are the worst:  
- The text is already slightly blurry due to scanning,  
- If they lower screen brightness to protect their eyes, the text becomes a grey smudge,  
- If they raise brightness to read clearly, the screen becomes a blinding spotlight in the dark room.  

After reading two chapters, their eyes hurt, tear up and everything has double vision.

**Observations:**
- Scanned PDFs + dark room = **very poor readability**.
- Hard to find a brightness level that balances legibility and comfort.
- Combination of visual fatigue and bad source quality creates significant strain.

**Themes:** `scanned_pdfs`, `night_reading`, `eye_strain`

---

### Q6: Feature that would reduce anxiety about tasks
**Question:** “If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?”

**Response (summary):**  
They would love a **“fail-risk calculator” or “pass-line guardian”**.  
Currently, apps push them to complete everything. Instead, they want a feature that can say:  
“For this module you did well in the midterm; this assignment is only 2% of the total. If you are really exhausted today, not submitting it might drop your mark from 90 to 88, which doesn’t affect your GPA much. It’s okay to sleep.”  

In other words, the tool should help **quantify the cost of skipping a task**, and tell them “it’s safe to let this one go”, rather than forcing them to behave like a superhero. For an overworked student, this kind of information would be a huge relief.

**Observations:**
- Needs **transparent risk assessment**, not just more reminders.
- Anxiety partly comes from not knowing the true impact of dropping a task.
- Wants support to make rational trade-offs, not pressure to do everything.

**Themes:** `risk_assessment`, `grade_impact`, `stress_management`

---

## Summary (Participant C)

**Main pain points:**
1. Sudden fear of missing a deadline while on the move; needs quick, trustworthy reassurance.  
2. Assignment sources are fragmented across many channels, forcing manual aggregation and increasing anxiety.  
3. Misremembered deadlines can cause severe late penalties and impact long-term academic goals.  
4. Keyboard interaction with citation editing dialogs is frustrating, especially under deadline pressure.  
5. Scanned PDFs are very hard to read at night; there is no comfortable brightness/clarity balance.  
6. Current tools assume everything must be done; they need help quantifying which tasks can be safely dropped to reduce stress.
