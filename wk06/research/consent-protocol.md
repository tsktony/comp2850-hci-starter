## Purpose

I am doing short peer interviews (5–10 minutes) to understand how people use task managers and to identify accessibility and usability problems. This is part of my COMP2850 coursework for Weeks 6–11.

## What You Will Do

I will ask you 3–5 open questions about how you manage tasks (for example, “Tell me about the last time you used a to-do list or task manager”).  
I will take brief text notes. I will **not** record audio or video unless you explicitly agree.

## Data Collected

**I will collect:**

- Pseudonymised notes (for example, “Participant A said …”)  
- Date and time of the interview  
- High-level context (for example, “uses keyboard a lot”, “prefers dark mode”)

**I will not collect:**

- Your real name (unless you explicitly want to be acknowledged)  
- Student ID number  
- Email address  
- Any other personally identifiable information (PII)

## Data Storage

- Stored in my local Git repository on my laptop (private, not public)  
- Accessible only to me (and teaching staff if needed for marking)  
- Kept until the end of Semester 1 (January 2026), then deleted or fully anonymised

## Your Rights

- You can stop the interview at any time, without giving a reason.  
- You can ask to see my notes about you.  
- You can ask me to delete your notes; I will do this as soon as possible.  
- If you have concerns, you can contact the module team or the University’s Data Protection Officer.

## Consent

Before starting I will check that you:

- Understand the purpose of this activity.  
- Know what data I will collect and how it is stored.  
- Know that you can withdraw at any time.

If you say “yes” to taking part, I will note:

- Date and time of the interview  
- Pseudonym assigned (for example, “Participant A”)  
- That verbal consent was given
