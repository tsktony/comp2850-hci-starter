# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

Based on interviews with Participant A, B and C.

---

## Story S1: Reassurance about deadlines

**Situation**  
When I suddenly worry that I might have missed a deadline (for example, while I’m walking, queueing for food, or on the bus),

**Motivation**  
I want to quickly see a trustworthy overview of what is due today and this week,

**Outcome**  
so I can calm down, know that I haven’t blown up an important deadline, and go back to what I was doing,

**Because**  
missing even one submission can have a big impact on my grade or my relationship with others, and the feeling of “maybe I forgot something” is very stressful.

**Evidence**  
- Participant C, Q1: checking the UniLeeds app in the breakfast queue just to confirm the group peer review deadline.  
- Participant C, Q3: misremembered a 17:00 deadline and got a 30% late penalty.  
- Participant A, Q3: nearly missed an important coursework deadline.

**Inclusion risk**  
Cognitive load, anxiety, students with executive function difficulties.

**Type**  
Job story (deadline reassurance)

## Story S2: Fragmented task sources

**Situation**  
When different teachers put tasks in different places (assignment area, announcements, group chat, or only spoken at the end of class),

**Motivation**  
I want a single place where I can see all my tasks in a clear list,

**Outcome**  
so I don’t have to act like a detective, copy-pasting from many channels and worrying that I have missed one,

**Because**  
if I miss even one spoken instruction or hidden announcement, I can lose participation marks or damage my grade.

**Evidence**  
- Participant C, Q2: tasks scattered across Minerva assignments, announcements and verbal reminders.  
- Participant B, Q2: pain of transferring tasks from chat messages into a to-do app.  

**Inclusion risk**  
Cognitive (memory), stress, students who rely on written records rather than listening.

**Type**  
Job story (centralisation / aggregation)

## Story S3: Full keyboard access and focus control

**Situation**  
When I am using only the keyboard (because my mouse is broken, I have RSI, or I just prefer keyboard),

**Motivation**  
I want to be able to reach every button, link and input in the interface using Tab, Enter, Space and arrow keys,

**Outcome**  
so I can add, edit and delete tasks without being forced to reach for a mouse,

**Because**  
when focus jumps around unpredictably or skips important controls (like delete or confirm), I feel excluded and lose time trying to fight the interface instead of doing my work.

**Evidence**  
- Participant A, Q4 (from earlier notes): focus getting stuck on background elements instead of on the close button.  
- Participant B, Q4: cannot move Kanban cards between columns with the keyboard.  
- Participant C, Q4: citation edit dialogs where Tab only hits “OK/Cancel/More”, not the input fields.

**Inclusion risk**  
Keyboard-only users, people with motor impairments, temporary injuries (e.g. broken mouse), power users who prefer keyboard.

**Type**  
Job story (keyboard accessibility, focus management)  
**WCAG**  
2.1.1 Keyboard (A), 2.4.3 Focus Order (AA)

## Story S4: Readability when eyes are tired or lighting is bad

**Situation**  
When my eyes are tired or the lighting is poor (strong sunlight or late at night in a dark room),

**Motivation**  
I want text, lists and buttons in the task manager to be easy to read and follow line by line,

**Outcome**  
so I don’t have to squint, guess, or constantly use my finger or mouse highlight just to keep my place,

**Because**  
tight line spacing, low contrast or blurry text quickly cause eye strain and make it easy to misread or skip tasks.

**Evidence**  
- Participant B, Q5: dense task lists with very tight line spacing cause lines to “merge together”.  
- Participant A, Q5 (earlier notes): low-contrast “minimalist” designs become unreadable in bright light.  
- Participant C, Q5: scanned PDFs at night are hard to read; brightness either makes text too blurry or too glaring.

**Inclusion risk**  
Low vision, colour-blindness, people with eye strain, situational impairments (bright sunlight, dark dorm rooms).

**Type**  
Job story (visual design / readability)  
**WCAG**  
1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum, AA), 1.4.8 Visual Presentation (AAA, partially)

## Story S5: Managing stress instead of demanding perfection

**Situation**  
When my task list is full and I am exhausted or overwhelmed,

**Motivation**  
I want the task manager to help me understand which tasks are truly critical and which ones I can safely postpone or even skip,

**Outcome**  
so I can reduce my anxiety, protect my health and still stay above the pass mark or hit my most important goals,

**Because**  
right now most tools treat all tasks as equally important, which makes me feel like a failure if I don’t complete everything.

**Evidence**  
- Participant A, Q6: wants a “smart forgiveness” feature that helps remove or postpone non-urgent tasks.  
- Participant B, Q6: wants a geofenced “hide stressful tasks when I’m at home relaxing” mode.  
- Participant C, Q6: wants a “fail-risk calculator / pass-line guardian” that quantifies the impact of skipping a task.

**Inclusion risk**  
Students with high stress, anxiety, depression, ADHD or heavy workloads.

**Type**  
Job story (emotional support / stress management)

## Story S6: Clear confirmation and error feedback

**Situation**  
When I add, edit or delete a task (especially under time pressure),

**Motivation**  
I want clear, accessible confirmation or error messages that I can see or hear immediately,

**Outcome**  
so I can trust that the action worked (or know exactly what went wrong) without refreshing the page or hunting through the list,

**Because**  
when nothing obvious happens after I press a button, I don’t know if the system is slow, broken or if I made a mistake.

**Evidence**  
- Participant A, earlier notes: having to refresh the page to confirm whether something saved.  
- Participant B, Q2: frustration when interfaces give no clear “it worked” signal.  
- Our own Lab 1 no-JS path: PRG redirect currently does not show explicit success or error messages.

**Inclusion risk**  
Screen reader users (need live region announcements), low digital literacy, people under stress or with memory issues.

**Type**  
Job story (status feedback / error handling)  
**WCAG**  
3.3.1 Error Identification (A), 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)
